# iris_matching
Designed and implemented a multi-biometric iris recognition system leveraging CNNs for feature extraction and classification.

Applied preprocessing (iris localization & normalization), similarity matching (cosine & Euclidean), and fusion strategies (Highest Rank, Borda Count, Logistic Regression) to improve accuracy and robustness.

Utilized Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib for dataset handling, training, and visualization.
